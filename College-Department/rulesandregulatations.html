            <h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
           <!-- Rules and Regulations Section -->
<section id="rules">
    <h3>Absenteeism and Make-up Tests</h3>
    <p>Students who are absent from a component or Mid-semester test due to valid reasons will be given another opportunity. However, they must submit the relevant documentation as soon as they return to the college within a week. The required pro-forma for rewriting the Mid-semester test or assignment component is available on the website. The permission for the same will be granted at the discretion of Fr. Principal, based on the recommendation of the course teacher and the Head of the Department (HoD).</p>

    <h3>Eligibility for Semester Exams</h3>
    <p>Students are eligible to write Semester Exams only after achieving a minimum score of 40 marks in a course for UG programmes and 50 marks for PG programmes. Please note that there is no CIA Improvement. Students who fail to acquire the minimum CIA marks will be entitled to appear for CIA Arrears.</p>

    <h3>CIA Arrears</h3>
    <p>CIA Arrears, if any, during the study years, will have the same components as those of the Regular CIA. The Library Attendance Marks will be carried forward to the CIA Arrears from the regular study. The time interval for clearing CIA Arrears will be a period of TWO years, with a maximum of FOUR attempts, using the same syllabus. After a student leaves the college, the CIA Arrears will consist of one 3-hour test for 70 marks and one assignment component for 30 marks.</p>

    <h3>Community Service Requirement</h3>
    <p>Community Service (SHEPHERD) is a unique and compulsory course for all UG & PG students. Additionally, the SHEPHERD course in Part-V, Foundation Courses, and the Bridge Course in English in Part-IV are also essential courses in the UG degree programme. Students who fail to meet the requirements of these courses will not be eligible to receive their degree certificate.</p>

    <h3>Malpractices</h3>
    <h4>Malpractice in Mid/End Semester Tests</h4>
    <p>In the event of a malpractice in the Mid or End Semester tests, the CIA for that particular course will be scrapped. Students will not be permitted to appear for the semester examinations for that course alone but will be allowed to do so in the consecutive semester as an arrear course, after acquiring the required CIA marks.</p>

    <h4>Malpractice in Semester Examinations</h4>
    <p>If malpractice occurs in the Semester Examinations, all courses for that semester will be canceled, except for courses such as Practical, Project, and Internship. However, the student's CIA marks will still be considered. The student will not be permitted to appear for two semesters (including the current one) and can appear only after two semesters. The student is still permitted to appear for arrear examinations.</p>

    <h4>Malpractice in Arrear Examinations</h4>
    <p>In the case of malpractice in the Arrear Examinations, all arrear courses will be canceled. The student will be allowed to appear only after two semesters (including the current one). The student's CIA marks will still be considered.</p>

    <h3>Time Ceiling for Completion of Degree</h3>
    <p>The Academic Council allows UG students to complete their program within five years (3+2) and PG students within four years (2+2). In the case of any changes in the course syllabus, the equivalent course, as identified by the respective HoDs and the Dean of the School, will be considered for the CIA and Semester Examination. Previous CIA marks will not be considered for acquiring the degree if there is a syllabus change.</p>
